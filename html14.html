                            <h3>Dosa also called as Dosai (in Tamil language) is a famous and popular South Indian
                                breakfast or snack in India as well
                                in the rest of the world. Dosa are basically crispy or soft crepes made with ground and
                                fermented lentil and rice batter</h3>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h3>To make the batter, first the lentils and rice are soaked in water for 4 to 5 hours.
                                They are then ground separately to
                                a fine consistency.

                                Then both the lentil batter and the rice batter are mixed with salt in a wide bowl or
                                pan. This batter is then allowed
                                to ferment overnight or for 8 to 9 hours.</h3>

                        <li>
                            <h3>After the batter is fermented, it increases in volume, has a pleasant fermented aroma
                                and a slightly sour taste. A
                                well-fermented batter makes the best dosa. You will also see many tiny air-pockets in
                                the batter.

                                Making the batter and then fermenting it is such a joy that I always look forward to
                                making fermented foods like dosa
                                and Idli.

                                The fermented batter is poured on a seasoned cast-iron pan or skillet (tawa) and spread
                                like a pancake and cooked till
                                crispy and golden with a drizzle of oil or ghee</h3>
